ACCELAID - an AI-powered Accelerated Learning Agent designed to support teachers, canceling any further burden. 
Our app generates personalized study plans, exams, and learning materials, helping teachers guide students through accelerated learning while keeping track of their progress. Unlike other solutions that focus on students, we empower teachers to maximize their impact, ensuring more students can catch up effectively without placing additional strain on families. Furthermore, our app provides contextualized content tailored to the specific curricula of different regions, a feature often missing in generic solutions.

Success will be measured by student progress (targeting a 70% improvement in pilot tests) and teacher satisfaction rates, reinforced by continuous feedback and data tracking. To ensure sustainability, we will integrate ACCELAID into national education frameworks, train teachers, and scale through NGO partnerships, multilingual features, and ongoing updates. A mix of government funding and external partnerships will secure long-term support and sustainability. 

Our technology leverages AI in a cross-platform app - making it accessible across all devices, with a user-friendly interface requiring minimal technical skills, and using Firebase as its data store. Key features include student profile creation, automated homework and assessment generation, personalized study plans, and progress tracking, all aligned with officially published curricula—currently piloted with Syria’s Ministry of Education framework, with a plan to further expand and cater to as many countries and curricula as needed.
