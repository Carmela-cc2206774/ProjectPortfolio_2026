# Project Phase 1

Phase 1 focused on designing and prototyping the application using a file-based approach. It emphasized application architecture, including entity and class diagrams, service and repository layers, API endpoint definitions, and UI/UX sketches. Extensive testing screenshots were included to demonstrate functional flows for students, instructors, and coordinators.

Data was handled through local JSON files, and this phase primarily validated the systems logic, navigation, and overall feature completeness without a real database backend.

Note:
- Significant experimentation with UI/UX designs done during this phase - some designs were later removed or refined in Phase 2.
- Phase 1 does not include sign-up functionality, as reflected in the documentation and report.

# Project Phase 2

In contrast, Phase 2 concentrated on database integration and backend robustness. It replaced file-based storage with a relational database using Prisma, introducing an ER diagram, schema definitions, seed data, and fully implemented database repositories.

The focus shifted from UI design to data persistence, integrity, and scalability, while retaining and re-testing all core functionalities (login, assessments, comments, and reports) against the database. Phase 2 represents the transition from a functional prototype to a production-ready, data-driven system.
